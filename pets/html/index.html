            But you know, I can't think of a better way to spend your life. I mean, what's life for if not finding
            yourself and trying to become the best, most genuine version of you that you can be?
            况且，人这一辈子，若到头来都认不清自己、未能长成最好最真实的自己，还有什么意义呢？

            That's what Steve Jobs meant when he said this at a Stanford University commencement speech:
            正如史蒂夫-乔布斯在斯坦福大学的毕业典礼上所言：

            Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of others' opinions
            drown out your own inner voice.
            时间宝贵，不要虚掷光阴过着他人的生活。不要让周遭的聒噪言论蒙蔽你内心的声音。

            You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your
            gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference
            in my life.
            你要相信，生活中的偶然冥冥中也能指引未来。你要心怀信念——相信你的直觉、命运、生活抑或因缘。这个方法一直给我力量，促使我过得卓然不同。

            The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't
            settle.
            成大事的唯一途径就是做自己喜欢的事情。若你还没找到，那就继续追寻吧，不要停下来。

            Now, let's for a moment be realistic about this. Insightful as that advice may be, it sounds a little too
            amorphous and challenging to resonate with today's quick-fix culture. These days, if you can't tell people
            exactly what to do and how to do it, it falls on deaf ears.
            现在我们来实际一点：建议或许很深刻，但听完却让人无从着手，难以运用到当今的快节奏文化中。现如今，如果一个建议讲不清具体做什么、该怎么做的话，那么说了也等于白说。

            Not only that, but what Jobs was talking about, what I'm talking about, requires focus and discipline, two
            things that are very hard to come by these days. Why? Because, focus and discipline are hard. It's so much
            easier to give in to distraction and instant gratification. Easy and addictive.
            不仅如此，乔布斯的讲话和我要说的话都需要集中和自制——这两个品质在当今社会非常难能可贵。何以见得？因为集中和自制都不容易做到。人们很容易分散注意力、寻求即时快感——舒服且容易上瘾。

            To give you a little incentive to take on the challenge, to embark on the road to self-discovery, here are
            three huge benefits from working to become the best, most genuine version of yourself.
            为激励你迎接挑战、踏上寻求自我的旅途，我列出了成为最好最真实自己后的三大益处：

            It will make you happy. Getting to know yourself will make you feel more comfortable in your own skin. It
            will reduce your stress and anxiety. It will make you a better spouse, a better parent, a better friend. It
            will make you a better person. Those are all pretty good reasons, if you ask me.
            你会感到快乐。了解自己后会让你更愉悦地接受自己，减轻你的压力和焦虑，使你成为更好的伴侣、父母、朋友，让你成为一个更美好的人。这些益处难道不够说服你为之努力吗？

            Besides, you really won't achieve anything significant in life until you know the real you. Not your brand,
            your LinkedIn profile, how you come across, or what anyone thinks of you. The genuine you. There's one
            simple reason why you shouldn't try to be something you're not, and it's that you can't. The real you will
            come out anyway. So forget your personal brand and start spending time on figuring out who you really are
            and trying to become the best version of that you can be.
            而且，只有了解真实的自己方能成就大事。你需要了解那个真实的你，而不是你的品牌、名誉、LinkedlIn资料、你的过去抑或他人对你的看法。为什么你不应该过他人的生活？很简单，因为首先你不是“其他人”，你的本性总有一天会现形
